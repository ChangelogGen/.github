Out of curiosity and wanting to solve my own problems, I started building [ChangelogGen](https://www.changeloggen.com).

**Curiosity part**
- Wanting to build a complete app with a code for the first time
- Using AI to build my app

**Solving my own problems**
- Automatically creating a changelog that is user friendly and on the website
- Sending Slack notifications with the most important product updates to your customers and the internal team

**[Features](https://www.changeloggen.com/#features)**
- **GitHub sync**: Automatically sync closed issues and add them to the changelog.
- **AI Analysis & Generation**: AI processes and summarizes your closed issues, making them human-readable and orienting them towards your value prop.
- **SEO-Friendly**: SEO-friendly changelog widget, structured and indexed by search engines, driving organic traffic directly to your site.
- **Embeddable**: Showcase your changelog on your website.

**[Pricing](https://www.changeloggen.com/#pricing)**

Iâ€™m starting with a lifetime deal until I fully launch the app, the goal is the end of November. Then it will be recurring billing starting from $19 monthly.
